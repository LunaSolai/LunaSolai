- 👋 Hi, I’m @LunaSolai
- 👀 I’m interested in AI project management. New to the game but passionnated by this revolution that is shifting the old paradigm. I'm a French speaker but live in Canada since over a decade now, so don't take nothing personal if I express myself in a weird way.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about web development just to gain the fundamentals in order to be able to develop projects involving AI. I have 1000 crazy ideas per minute but don't know yet how to implement them. That being said, I won't learn programming per say, I would have if I had have 3 lives in one...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate, at least, to keep up on specific GAI development for futur crazy ideas/projects. Especialy on music recognition...
- 😄 Pronouns: She
- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that...? Hahaha
